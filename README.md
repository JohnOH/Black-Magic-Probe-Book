# Debugging, Tracing & Programming with the Black Magic Probe
This guide covers setting up and using the [Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic). The Black Magic Probe is a relatively cheap JTAG/SWD probe for ARM Cortex micro-controllers. A distinguishing feature of the Black Magic Probe is that it embeds a GDB server. As a result, the GNU Debugger can directly connect to the Black Magic Probe.
While setting up and using the Black Magic Probe has also been covered in wikis and blogs, I found that those description often only scratched the surface of the subject. With this guide, I set out to give a more comprehensive account.
## Utilities
Several utilities accompagny this guide. Some are small, such as `bmscan` to locate the (virtual) serial port at which the Black Magic Probe is found. Another is a helper tool for a specific family of micro-controllers (`elf-postlink`). There are GUI utilities and text-mode utilities. All have been tested under Microsoft Windows and Linux.
